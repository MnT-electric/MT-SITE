description: Installing a Flatscreen TV mount is the kind of project that looks like easy, at first. But once you start putting holes in your wall and wondering what to do with all the wires, it quickly becomes apparent that it is more complicated. Is the mount installed securely to the wall studs? Is it leveled? Is it even the right mount for your TV? Not to mention, the tools and hardware cost you will spend on just a basic Flatscreen TV installation. Whatâ€™s more, a poorly installed TV mount can be a danger to your children and pets. MT&T electric specialists inspect installation area and explain installation to customer before we begin.
